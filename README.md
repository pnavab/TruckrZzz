# TruckrZzz
### Our TreeHacks2024 project

An all in one smart solution for early drowsiness detection in truck drivers by using real time body data and computer vision to alert the drivers before it is too late. 

Built using Reflex for the web framework, TerraAPI for livestreaming heartrate data, Swift for the iOS companion app, and a complex backend to handle and process all the data
